# Discourse Permalink Plugin

**ATTENTION**: this plugin is defunc on vanilla discourse at the moment due to incompability with other plugins.

This plugin allows for custom permalinks for topics.

## Details

Through this plugin a topic can now have a `permalink`-custom_field for lookup that it can be found it.

The plugin operates in two modes: redirect and legacy-mode. When the permalink_redirect setting is set to true (default) in the Administration interface, the plugin will match the permalink and when found redirect to the new URL â€“ this is recommended behaviour. If disabled however, the topic will be only accessible through that permalink and use that instead of the generated links.

.Attention: This plugin requires discourse >= 0.9.9.7 . Please upgrade to master.

## Installation

Just two easy steps. From your main discourse do:

    cd plugins
    git clone https://github.com/ligthyear/discourse-plugin-permalink.git   # clone the repo here
    cd ..
    rake assets:precompile                      # precompile assets
